<p><h3>About me</h3></p>
___

I have recently joined Reliance Jio (AICoE) as a Manager in the role of Senior Data Scientist. 

I have completed my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). I am interested in the research work related to machine learning, data mining and application of these techniques. In particular NLP, short text mining and sports data mining. My dissertation research is focused on mining strengths and weaknesses of cricket players using the live ball-by-ball text commentary data available in commercial sports websites such as EspnCricInfo. Recently, I have presented my research in ICMLA19 (Florida, USA), ESANN20 (Bruges, Belgium), MLSA20 (Ghent, Belgium), CMSAC20 (CMU, USA), OSUSAAC20 (Columbus, USA).

Before this, I spent two years pursuing M.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati where I worked on a convex optimisation problem - Spectral Clustering using Convex and Constrained Settings'.
